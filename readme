Vague instructions:

* Cropped screenshots go in the input folders (this is also where the config is)
* Result goes into the site folders
* Various information is cached in the cache folder. Some of it needs to be deleted to produce new results - specifically the manifests in the root. 
  cache/api is all information from the gw2 apis, so probably shouldn't need to be deleted.
* The java file to run is au.net.immortius.wardrobe.legacy.GuaranteedWardrobeUnlockAnalyser.

Images should be cropped hard on the left side to the start of the tiles. Some leeway is allowed for on the other side - except for dyes, those need to be pretty accurate.
