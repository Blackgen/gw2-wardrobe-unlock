General Information

This is an application for building the Wardrobe Unlock Analyser site. 

Input folder contains all the input needed to build the site - grouping, acquisition metadata and guaranteed wardrobe unlock preview screenshots.
Cache folder contains the intermediate information generated by the site builder, including cached results from the Guild Wars 2 API and Wiki.
Site contains the website itself. Building the site creates a content.json file that contains information on all the unlocks available, and one or more image maps of the unlock icons.
