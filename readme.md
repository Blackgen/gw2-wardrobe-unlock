# Wardrobe Unlock Analyser

Wardrobe Unlock Analyser is a web site for exploring the various unlocks that can be obtained in Guild Wars 2. It has two major components:

* A set of Java processes for extracting and processing and collating information on unlocks from the Guild Wars 2 API, Wiki and developer provided input
* The site itself, as pure html5/css/javascript using jquery.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Java 8

### Installing

Obtain screenshots of the Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock preview and place in the input\x-gwu folder for each type unlock.

Build the site (locally) with:

```gradlew.bat run```

Run the site locally with something like Web Server for Chrome, or upload in full to some location.

## Further Information

Input folder contains all the input needed to build the site - grouping, acquisition metadata and guaranteed wardrobe unlock preview screenshots.
Cache folder contains the intermediate information generated by the site builder, including cached results from the Guild Wars 2 API and Wiki.
Site contains the website itself. Building the site creates a content.json file that contains information on all the unlocks available, and one or more image maps of the unlock icons.
